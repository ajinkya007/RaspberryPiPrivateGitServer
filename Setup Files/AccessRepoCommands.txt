#First open up git bash in a different folder and then run the following commands:

git clone pi@192.168.1.108:/home/pi/git/myFirstRepository/

#Accessing the Private GIT server remotely

#Now you may want to access your GIT repositories outside your local network. To do this you will need to setup port forwarding on your router.
ssh://pi@XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:23/home/pi/git/myFirstRepository.git/

#Where X represents your external IP and 23 is the external port.
